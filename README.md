# Equipment for biology labs

This repository contains 3D printable parts for use in biology laboratories.

## Installation

Begin by cloning this repository and all its submodules using the following command:

````
git clone --recursive https://github.com/icaven/labware
````

Then use [OpenSCAD](https://www.openscad.org) to render files compatible with your 
printer's slicing software (such as .stl or .3mf).

Multi-nozzle suction head
-------

This part may be attached to a robot arm to pick up lids of petri dishes when connected to a 
vacuum pump.

The part has a [GoPro](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=gopro) compatible fitting 
 to join to the robot arm.

By default, the design has three nozzles, but this is customisable.

Print settings
----

The multi-nozzle was printed with the default parameter values using about 17 grams of PLA filament, at a layer height
of 0.15 mm and infill of 15%.  The heated bed temperature was 62 C for the first layer and 60 C afterwards.  The print
time was 1 hour and 55 minutes.  The part is printed with the nozzles at the top of the print.


Suction cup
----

Printed suction cups, made from a flexible material such as thermoplastic 
polyurethane (TPU), must be fitted onto each of the barbed nozzles. 

_This part has not yet been printed to test the design since existing pieces of the same dimensions were available._
