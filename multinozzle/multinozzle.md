# Multi-nozzle suction head

This part may be attached to a robot arm to pick up lids of petri dishes when connected to a 
vacuum pump.

The part has a [GoPro](https://www.thingiverse.com/search?q=gopro) compatible fitting 
 to join to the robot arm.

By default, the design has three nozzles, but this is customisable.

Print settings
----

The multi-nozzle was printed with the default parameter values using about 17 grams of PLA filament, at a layer height
of 0.15 mm and infill of 15%.  The heated bed temperature was 62 C for the first layer and 60 C afterward.  The print
time was 1 hour and 55 minutes.  The part is printed with the nozzles at the top of the print.

Suction cup
----

Printed suction cups, made from a flexible material such as thermoplastic 
polyurethane (TPU), must be fitted onto each of the barbed nozzles. 

_Some prints were made using TPU, and I found that the design needs some modifications are needed, so
this is still a work in progress._
